Jung-Woo Choi received his B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Korea, in 1999, 2001, and 2005, respectively. He was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Center for Noise and Vibration Control (NOVIC) at KAIST from 2005 to 2006. From 2006 to 2007, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR), University of Southampton, UK. From 2007 to 2011, he was with Samsung Electronics at the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) in Korea. He was a Research Associate Professor of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, KAIST until 2014. He joined the School of Electrical Engineering, KAIST in 2015 and is working as an Associate Professor there.

Prof. Choi’s primary research area includes AI architectures for auditory scene analysis and synthesis, and array signal processing for loudspeaker/microphone arrays. His research interests also include multichannel speech enhancement, source separation, and sound synthesis for various acoustic systems. He is the co-author of the book: Sound Visualization and Manipulation (Wiley 2013). 

He is the member of IEEE, Audio Engineering Society, Korean Society for Noise and Vibration Engineering, and Acoustical Society of America.
